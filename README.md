# Statistics
  The purpose of these projects are to learn and apply statistical methods.

  * A click-rate on two version of websites are analysed with Bayesian Interference:
    https://github.com/do4am/Statistics/blob/master/Bayesian%20Interference/Marketing%20Campaign.ipynb
    
    Mirror: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/do4am/Statistics/blob/master/Bayesian%20Interference/Marketing%20Campaign.ipynb
    
  * German GDP are analysed with Linear Regression: 
    https://github.com/do4am/Statistics/blob/master/LinearRegression/Linear%20Regression.ipynb
    
    Mirror: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/do4am/Statistics/blob/master/LinearRegression/Linear%20Regression.ipynb

## Note:
  The dataset were self-made or got downloaded from public database source like IMF.

  Just a side note: it takes time to load a __*.ipynb__ and even fail to load sometime, but keep reloading will eventually solve the problem.

  I am still working on another project.

## Tools used: 
  Python 2.7 with various modules NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Pymc3, matplotlib...

## Acknowledgement
  The Click-Through Rate Analysed is inspired from : https://www.datascience.com/blog/introduction-to-bayesian-inference-learn-data-science-tutorials
  - Re-implemented and gave explaination based on my understanding.
  - Added analyst on different examples with different sample size.
  - Added analyst on "what is the probabilty that posterior of version B is actualy greater than the posterior of version A."
