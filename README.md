# Statistics
The purpose of these projects are to learn and apply statistical methods.

The dataset were self-made or got downloaded from public database source like IMF.
Please find detail of each project in __*.ipynb__ file contained in each folder. 

Just a side note: it takes time to load a __*.ipynb__ and even fail to load sometime, but keep reloading will eventually solve the problem.

I am still working on another project.

Tools used: Python 2.7 with various modules NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Pymc3, matplotlib...
